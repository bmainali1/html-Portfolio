  As I move forward, I will continue to pursue my passions, pushing myself to new heights in sports and finding new ways to lend a helping hand to those in need. 
  I believe that by combining my love for sports with my desire to make a positive impact, I can inspire others and create a better world, one small act of kindness at a time.</p>
